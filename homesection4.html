          "Do you have ears to hear? I am a Christian and I have a loved one with schizophrenia. I don't know if there exists another resource like this. It is very easy to read: Suzanne walks you through the text (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) - you can even follow along in your own bible! but the commentary specifically related to schizophrenia and Jesus' humanity is invaluable. You can find many resources on the physical and emotional sides of schizophrenia, but if you're a Christian, THIS is the information you need. Suzanne has given us a gift to view schizophrenia through a lens no one else is looking through."

          â€œSuzanne's ministry has truly transformed my faith. I now understand what I have been experiencing. SPIRITUAL GIFTS? Supernatural spiritual gifts? Who knew? Things have gotten so much better for me since I stopped listening to the lies of all of the "Schizophrenic Voices" that have tortured me since my early 20's. I now put my focus into reading the bible and trusting the words written in the pages to continue to answer questions to the things I have seen and heard. Suzanne was right; each one's answers will be revealed by simply reading the bible even if I don't fully understand it yet. I see my life within the pages. Suzannes ministry has given me hope and led me towards recovery from schizophrenia. As she states, "We are not sick!"
