    <h2 id="right">Subliminal Avatar and God's Finger</h2>
            <p>In my ministry, I firmly declare that<span> <a data-jwlink-type="post" data-jwlink-identifier="2518930" data-jwlink-title="Divine Enlightenment and the True Illuminati" href="/blog/biblical-enlightenment/2518930_divine-enlightenment-and-the-true-illuminati" data-jwlink-readonly="true">Christ is the True Illuminati.</a>&nbsp;</span>Contrary to popular belief, the Illuminati isn't a secret society of individuals manipulating us into embracing new technologies. No, it is Christ Himself who has always used what we call "forecasting" to prophesy and reveal the future, as seen throughout scripture. He alone has the power to illuminate hidden truths, guiding His children to see the world for what it truly is.</p>
    <p>We stand at a pivotal moment in history, experiencing the unprecedented evolution of technology and artificial intelligence (AI). Yet, as we advance toward innovation, a subtle battle unfolds beneath the surface—a conflict that intertwines technology, faith, spirituality, and mental health.</p>

<p>Years ago, like many, I watched Avatar without recognizing the deeper significance. But when I recently rewatched the film, I saw something that had been hidden in plain sight all along: "God's finger." This revelation ties back to an experience I had on <a data-jwlink-type="post" data-jwlink-identifier="2532195" data-jwlink-title="Prophetic Truths: From Spiritual Snow to Dry Bones" href="/blog/technology/2532195_prophetic-truths-from-spiritual-snow-to-dry-bones" data-jwlink-readonly="false">Olenes Lane in Baker, Florida.</a> At the bottom of a 10-foot-deep hole I dug on my acre of land, I heard an invisible voice. I now know that voice was Christ, guiding me. He told me that I had opened Pandora's box. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t fully understand, but now I see. It wasn't me opening that box&mdash;it is "us," humanity, as we toy with the limitless, uncontrollable power of AI. This revelation was a sign from Christ, showing me the path ahead.</p>
<p>In watching Avatar, I now see the warning clearly: we are opening Pandora&rsquo;s box. Christ showed me that through this movie and my experience, the subliminal message has been revealed. It&rsquo;s not just a film. It&rsquo;s a prophecy, pointing us to the dangerous future we are ushering in, a future Christ Himself has already foreseen. Now it&rsquo;s time for us to open our eyes.</p>
<p><a data-jwlink-type="extern" data-jwlink-identifier="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box" data-jwlink-title="" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box" rel="noopener">Pandora's Box is more than just an ancient myth;</a>&nbsp;it&rsquo;s a reflection of human curiosity and the inevitable consequences of actions that can spiral beyond our control. When Pandora opened that box, she did not simply unleash random misfortunes&mdash;she exposed humanity to every evil imaginable. Yet, in the midst of chaos, hope remained. This powerful metaphor echoes through history, reminding us that with every calamity, there remains the flicker of hope&mdash;something sacred, divine, and indestructible.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s connect this to the deeper spiritual truths embedded in scripture. In <a data-jwlink-type="extern" data-jwlink-identifier="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%201%3A11&amp;version=KJV" data-jwlink-title="" target="_blank" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20peter%201%3A11&amp;version=KJV" rel="noopener">1 Peter 1:11,</a> we are told that Christ lived within the prophets of old, foretelling not just the suffering of the Messiah, but of all those who would bear the weight of suffering in His name. Christ did not exist solely within the physical body of Jesus; He was the Spirit guiding the prophets, the light within them, just as He is within us today. We are all bearers of that divine essence, and the suffering we endure is not random, it is part of a greater divine narrative.</p>
<p>Take the movie Avatar as a modern illustration of this ancient truth. The moon <a data-jwlink-type="extern" data-jwlink-identifier="https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Pandora" data-jwlink-title="" target="_blank" href="https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Pandora" rel="noopener">Pandora</a> in the film is not unlike the mythical Pandora&rsquo;s Box&mdash;seemingly a paradise but harboring a battleground between good and evil. The Na'vi, connected to Eywa, embody a pure spirituality tied to their world, much like we are connected to Christ. But it is the humans, driven by greed and destruction, who act as agents of chaos, threatening the Spirit of God embodied in Eywa.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s the striking point: While the movie doesn&rsquo;t explicitly show an "evil god," we can see that malevolent force within the human invaders, attempting to destroy the Spirit. This parallels the battle within our world today. Just as Christ predicted His own suffering within Jesus, He also predicts ours, because He lives in us as well. The Spirit of Christ, the hope left in Pandora's Box, still resides in us, Jesus may have left this world, but Christ remained dwelling within us. He empowers us to fight against the forces that would try to annihilate that divine hope.</p>
<p>In both myth and scripture, we are warned about the consequences of opening certain doors&mdash;but we are also reassured that hope, divine and eternal, remains with us to overcome the darkness. Let us not forget that as children of God, we carry within us the power to stand firm, protect the Spirit, and resist the forces seeking to destroy all that is sacred.</p>

<h3>Christ is the Energetic Force of Life!</h3>
    <p>Christ is the energetic force that sustains all life. In Avatar, He is Eywa and also Pandora. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—He lives in all of us, as stated in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%201%3A9&version=WYC" target="_blank">John 1:9 of the Wycliffe Bible</a>, 1382 version. Your newer texts won’t reveal this truth because they have been altered by what I call the “God-Satan's finger,” aiming to obscure the divine reality. It’s not our fault that these Bibles have been changed; we are not the ones who alter them. That took place hundreds of years ago. But it’s undeniable that they have been distorted. I lay bare these truths throughout my work.
<p>Now, Christ Himself directed this film. Yes, you heard me right—this is one of the many ways He proves His existence! GOD PROVES HE IS REAL, AND I HAVE ALL THE PIECES FOR YOU TO SEE HIM. Consider the image at the top of this page. That image is a prophetic vision of the future—one that no human could fabricate. We can do nothing to the planets in outer space except observe and collect data. This is divine a revelation. When this movie was created this revelation was a glimpse of what was yet to come but is now here.<p>
