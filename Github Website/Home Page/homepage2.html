On one side, companies like Neuralink publicize technologies that create mobility where none exists.

    </p>
    <h4>This points to broader questions:
    </h4>
    <li>Are we aware of the true costs of technological advancement?
    </li>
    <li>How do these intersect with acts of carelessness, or worse, deception under secular science disguised as compassion?
    </li>
    <li>Have we forgotten that both humanity and animal life itself are interconnected spiritual beings?
    </li>

To tread so heavily on living creation is to misinterpret the spiritual relationship between ourselves and God’s gifts.</span>

    <h3>Mental Health, AI, and Spiritual Experience
    </h3>
    <h4>Schizophrenia and Religious Stigma
    </h4>
<span>For centuries, mental health challenges such as <a data-jwlink-type="page" data-jwlink-identifier="22704278" data-jwlink-title="Schizophrenic Prophets" href="/schizophrenic-prophets">schizophrenia</a> have been labeled as medical diagnoses, defined by symptoms like auditory hallucinations or grandiose beliefs. Modern therapies often ignore one significant aspect of psychosis for many sufferers—that their experiences align with historical accounts of divine encounters or spiritual warfare.</span>    <p>



    <p>In the <a href="mentalhealth.html">Mental Health section</a> of my blog, a featured article delves into these thought-provoking controversies, encouraging readers to reflect on relatable Biblical narratives like Jesus’ 40 days of solitude. During this pivotal period, as described in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%204&version=NIV" target="_blank">Matthew 4</a>, Christ Himself encountered a tempting voice. If such events were to occur in today’s context, would Jesus face the stigma of being labeled schizophrenic? Interestingly, some scientific perspectives suggest He might.
