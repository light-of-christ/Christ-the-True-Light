<p>      The film Avatar tells the story of Jake Sully, a paraplegic former Marine who steps into his brother Tommy's place in the Avatar Program by chance, as his DNA is a perfect match to that of his twin brother, who has been murdered. The program allows humans to remotely drive genetically engineered Na'vi bodies with their very own conscious. A theme in my work: "consciousness," as this is where our souls are. Simply put, Jake Sully's consciousness enters the Avatar in order to drive it. The Avatar is the wheel that I consistently mention throughout my work. The door Jesus spoke about is found in our minds.

<p><strong>Revelation 3:20</strong> — Lo! I stand at the door, and knock; if any man heareth my voice, and openeth the gate to me [if any man shall hear my voice, and open the gate], I shall enter to him, and sup with him, and he with me.</p>

<p><strong>John 10:9</strong> — I am the door. If any man shall enter by me, he shall be saved; and he shall go in, and shall go out, and he shall find pastures.</p>
