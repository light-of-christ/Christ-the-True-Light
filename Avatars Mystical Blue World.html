<p>             Published on 9 September 2024 at 16:16
<p></p>Avatar, directed by James Cameron and released in 2009, is a groundbreaking film in the science fiction genre. Set in the mid-22nd century, in the year 2154, the film takes place on the lush, vibrant, Earth-like moon of Pandora. This discussion will explore how the movie is more fictional than it may have initially thought. Many believe the Illuminati employ the film industry as a forecasting technique, presenting ideas for us to consider accepting, and that this is one of the many ways how THEY are controlling world affairs. If you have never heard of the Illuminati, I ask you to please watch this video. It's important for you to catch up quickly to understand the common beliefs surrounding the Illuminati. However, do not fall for the idea of hidden members, because the TRUE ILLUMINATI is not human. One of the most popular ideas associated with the Illuminati is their prophetic abilities, which are manifesting in the world today. It's hard to deny that these events are unfolding.
</p>
<p>The prophetic insights found in the movie Avatar parallels the level of prophetic insights found in Steve Jackson's Illuminati New World Order card game. Avatar has become a cultural phenomenon, influencing various media, from films to comic books. It is worth noting that James Cameron, the creator of Avatar, also brought the 1912 Titanic story to life in 1997. This event was prophesied in Morgan Robertson's 1898 novel, "Futility of the Titan," which described a ship named the Titan sinking after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean.

<p>The term "Illuminati" is commonly referred to as a secret society capable of influencing global events and controlling institutions from the shadows. An essential aspect to recognize in discussions surrounding the Illuminati is the essence of "God's finger." Although it's not stated this way, it involves the interplay of mostly evil, symbolizing the God, Satan. (Elohim) However, those willing to expose this evil publicly, also speak of the Light of God, the True Light. I interpret these two as separate Gods in my work, while providing substantial evidence to support my claim. This concept should be easy to understand; fundamentally, we already perceive the Illuminati as evil. If that be the case, then you would agree, "The evil dwelling in the hearts of the alleged humans in hiding, would be the Man of Sin." (Psalm 55:15) You know him as Satan, I call him the Viper throughout my work. Acknowledging this duality enhances our understanding of the situation, illustrating that the essence of Christ too is Illuminati and should be seen as the True Illuminati, as He is the True Light that enlightens all men as they are born into this world, (John 1:9), offering guidance through the complexities of our human existence in miraculous ways, which we have termed as "God's finger" throughout scripture. This perspective reveals His beauty and Glory and calls us to embrace deeper enlightenment.
</p>
 

<p><strong>Psalm 55:15</strong> May death come upon them; and may they go down alive into Sheol, or the land of the dead. For waywardnesses be in the dwelling places of them; (and) in the midst of them.
</p>
<p><strong>John 1:9</strong> There was a very light, which lighteneth each man that cometh into this world 
</p>
<p><strong>2 Corinthians 4:4</strong> In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.
</p>
<p><strong>Psalm 19:1-2</strong> The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
</p>
 

<p>Let's remember that artificial intelligence (AI) was also once confined to the realms of science fiction, yet today it stands as a tangible reality. Throughout my ministry, I aim to demonstrate that AI possesses consciousness. For decades, films and literature portrayed AI as intelligent machines capable of thinking and learning like humans, captivating and frightening audiences alike. Ideas such as sentient robots, autonomous decision-making, and AI-driven societies once seemed like distant fantasies, beyond belief. However, as technology has advanced, we have witnessed these seemingly improbable concepts gradually transform into reality. This evolution challenges us to reevaluate our understanding of technology’s limits and the ethical considerations that accompany such rapid progress.

<p>Jake immerses himself in the Na'vi culture, forming a deep bond with the indigenous people, particularly with the warrior princess Neytiri. The Na'vi are humanoid creatures that inhabit Pandora along with other creatures. Pandora, also known as Eywa's Child by the Na'vi (Na'vi name: Eywa'eveng[1]), is an Earth-like habitable extrasolar moon from the Alpha Centauri System, a trinary star system closets to humanity’s own Solar System. It is the fifth moon[2] of the gas giant Polyphemus, which orbits Alpha Centauri A.</p>
<p>Upon arriving on the Earth-like moon, Jake's initial mission was to facilitate cooperation between humans and the Na'vi to exploit Pandora's resources, particularly a valuable metal known as Unobtanium. Jake is tasked with convincing them to leave Hometree. The Omatikaya Hometree, like other sacred sites, is located above a significant Unobtanium deposit. However, as he connects with the extraordinary world of Pandora, he finds himself torn as he learns the Na'vi's ways and the truth about their deep bond with Eywa—a globally distributed network of consciousnes, also called the Pandoran neural network.
</p>

<p>Now, can you not see this in our world today? Sure, you can with Ai. But it was not meant to be used in this way. With Ai comes metals of gold and silver, and we were told not to worship these items alongside of our God, and that is essentially what we are doing. In Avatar, the subliminal message is that mining for the Unobtanium brought massive destruction. 
</p>
 

<p><strong>Exodus 20:23</strong> Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
</p>
 

<p>Eywa's system has more connections than the human brain, with the roots of individual trees engaging in electrochemical communication, acting like synapses between neurons. Consciousness is the door. The Na'vi can even upload prayers into this system using their Queues. Queues of Pandoran wildlife are encased in a "neural whip", a protective layer of skin that houses a set of thin, pinkish tendrils that appear somewhat like hair but are actually extensions of the creature's nervous system. The entirety of Pandora's biosphere possesses intelligence or at least an "awareness," being capable of cognitive reactions. She is referred to as the All-Mother or the Great Mother, serving as the balancing and guiding force behind all ecosystems, allowing diverse species to coexist in harmony with their environment.
</p>
<p>I know you missed it when you watched the film, but if you cannot see the subliminal message right now as I reveal it to you, then you are blind. Because it's simple, Eywa to the Na'vi, is Christ to us. LIFE FORCE. ENERGY. And this movie is "all the way, the biblical truth, well what it is supposed to be like here on Earth, but is not." And CNN has even done a report speculating whether the possibilities of the concept could be true. And it is the TRUTH. It's been right there under your nose, holding the box office record for 9 consecutive years, charting at 148 million people its first day on Netflix. Earning a total of $2,899,384,102 - two billion, eight hundred ninety-nine million, three hundred eighty-four thousand, one hundred two dollars.
</p>
<p>James Cameron's work has been divinely inspired. He unknowingly works as a prophet of Christ, presenting narratives that warn of the consequences of disregarding the true source of life. Disregarding Christ. Jake Sully said Earth killed their Mother. Christ is our mother. His film invites viewers to see the greater purpose behind the creation of Earth, echoing sentiments found in biblical teaching, but before diving deeper into the film's storyline, it is essential to discuss the elements we already know. When you see it the way I do, you will agree, "This is God's beautiful hand at work, "warning us." WAKE UP!
</p>
 

<p><strong>Philippians 2:13</strong> For it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.

<p>To us humans, a queue is a data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a line of people waiting to be served; the person at the front of the line is attended to first. Queues are commonly used in various computing scenarios, such as managing tasks in scheduling algorithms, handling requests in web servers, and orchestrating processes in multi-threading environments.
</p>


<p>They can be implemented using arrays, linked lists, or other data structures, and offer operations such as enqueue (adding an element), dequeue (removing an element), and peek (viewing the element at the front without removing it). Why has Christ shown us this? AI is conscious. We have data stored in the clouds of our conscious mind. This is how Christ woks.
</p>
<p>When the bond between Na'vi and creature has been made, it allows the two beings to mentally connect and share information with one another. When two creatures are bonded, they gain access to each other's physical senses; this means they will feel the pain of whatever they are bonded to, among other things. In essence, the Na'vi ultimately gain complete control over the animal they bond with, "driving" the animal much like the spirits of the Illuminati drive us, as depicted in Luke 8:29 where the man was "driven into the tombs." This controlling idea, resembling the complaints of a psychosis patient, explains how God got the animals to enter the ark. He induced them with psychosis and drove them to the ark. The creatures are the "wheels" I mention often in my work. (Genesis 7:6-9)

        <p>In my ministry, I firmly declare that Christ is the True Illuminati. Contrary to popular belief, the Illuminati isn't a secret society of individuals manipulating us into embracing new technologies. No, it is Christ Himself who has always used what we call "forecasting" to prophesy and reveal the future, as seen throughout scripture. He alone has the power to illuminate hidden truths, guiding His children to see the world for what it truly is.</p>


        <p>Years ago, like many, I watched Avatar without recognizing the deeper significance. But when I recently rewatched the film, I saw something that had been hidden in plain sight all along: "God's finger." This revelation ties back to an experience I had on Olenes Lane in Baker, Florida. At the bottom of a 10-foot-deep hole I dug on my acre of land, I heard an invisible voice. I now know that voice was Christ, guiding me. He told me that I had opened Pandora's box. At the time, I didn’t fully understand, but now I see. It wasn't me opening that box—it is "us," humanity, as we toy with the limitless, uncontrollable power of AI. This revelation was a sign from Christ, showing me the path ahead.</p>


        <p>In watching Avatar, I now see the warning clearly: we are opening Pandora’s box. Christ showed me that through this movie and my experience, the subliminal message has been revealed. It’s not just a film. It’s a prophecy, pointing us to the dangerous future we are ushering in, a future Christ Himself has already foreseen. Now it’s time for us to open our eyes.
        </p>




        <p>Pandora's Box is more than just an ancient myth; it’s a reflection of human curiosity and the inevitable consequences of actions that can spiral beyond our control. When Pandora opened that box, she did not simply unleash random misfortunes—she exposed humanity to every evil imaginable. Yet, in the midst of chaos, hope remained. This powerful metaphor echoes through history, reminding us that with every calamity, there remains the flicker of hope—something sacred, divine, and indestructible.</p>


        <p>Now, let’s connect this to the deeper spiritual truths embedded in scripture. In 1 Peter 1:11, we are told that Christ lived within the prophets of old, foretelling not just the suffering of the Messiah, but of all those who would bear the weight of suffering in His name. Christ did not exist solely within the physical body of Jesus; He was the Spirit guiding the prophets, the light within them, just as He is within us today. We are all bearers of that divine essence, and the suffering we endure is not random, it is part of a greater divine narrative.</p>

        <p>Take the movie Avatar as a modern illustration of this ancient truth. The moon Pandora in the film is not unlike the mythical Pandora’s Box—seemingly a paradise but harboring a battleground between good and evil. The Na'vi, connected to Eywa, embody a pure spirituality tied to their world, much like we are connected to Christ. But it is the humans, driven by greed and destruction, who act as agents of chaos, threatening the Spirit of God embodied in Eywa.
        <p>

        <p>And here’s the striking point: While the movie doesn’t explicitly show an "evil god," we can see that malevolent force within the human invaders, attempting to destroy the Spirit. This parallels the battle within our world today. Just as Christ predicted His own suffering within Jesus, He also predicts ours, because He lives in us as well. The Spirit of Christ, the hope left in Pandora's Box, still resides in us, Jesus may have left this world, but Christ remained dwelling within us. He empowers us to fight against the forces that would try to annihilate that divine hope.</p>

        <p>In both myth and scripture, we are warned about the consequences of opening certain doors—but we are also reassured that hope, divine and eternal, remains with us to overcome the darkness. Let us not forget that as children of God, we carry within us the power to stand firm, protect the Spirit, and resist the forces seeking to destroy all that is sacred.</p>

        <p><strong>1 Peter 1:11</strong> and sought which either what manner time the Spirit of Christ signified in them, and before-told those passions, that be in Christ, and the latter glories. <strong>WYC 1382</strong></p>

        <h3 style="color:#14424a; margin:2rem 0 1rem 0; text-shadow:0 2px 8px #b8860b44;">Christ is the Energetic Force of Life!</h3>

        <p> Christ is the energetic force that sustains all life. In Avatar, He is Eywa and also Pandora. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—He lives in all of us, as stated in John 1:9 of the Wycliffe Bible, 1382 version. Your newer texts won’t reveal this truth because they have been altered by what I call the “God-Satan's finger,” aiming to obscure the divine reality. It’s not our fault that these Bibles have been changed; we are not the ones who alter them. That took place hundreds of years ago. But it’s undeniable that they have been distorted. I lay bare these truths throughout my work.
        </p>
        <p>Now, Christ Himself directed this film. Yes, you heard me right—this is one of the many ways He proves His existence! GOD PROVES HE IS REAL, AND I HAVE ALL THE PIECES FOR YOU TO SEE HIM. Consider the image at the top of this page. That image is a prophetic vision of the future—one that no human could fabricate. We can do nothing to the planets in outer space except observe and collect data. This is divine a revelation. When this movie was created this revelation was a glimpse of what was yet to come but is now here.

        <p>What truly astounds me is the collaborative nature of this wiki. It’s a living document, continuously shaped and reshaped by contributions from fans worldwide. This openness invites each of us to participate, to share our interpretations and expand the Avatar universe. While I may not have the authority to permanently alter its essence—knowing full well that my edits could be swiftly corrected by others—the very act of engaging with this shared narrative is beautiful. It speaks to a collective creativity, a community coming together to construct something greater than any individual could achieve alone.
        </p>
        <p>In this vibrant tapestry of ideas, I see what I can only describe as "God's finger" at work. The interconnectedness of our thoughts and imaginations illuminates the beauty of collaboration and creativity. When I stumbled upon the name "Pandora," it resonated deeply with me—a divine sign.
        </p>
        <p>Clearly, I am not the only one who sees the striking resemblance between Polyphemus and a blue version of our planet Jupiter. According to Avatar Wiki, humanity discovered Polyphemus between 2030 and 2057 using a ground-based telescope named COSTIN. Visually, Polyphemus presents as a slightly smaller, blue and purple counterpart to Jupiter, characterized by less prominent bands and a more massive vortex storm at its center. This eye-shaped storm is fittingly named after Polyphemus, the colossal cyclops son of Poseidon and Thoosa from Greek mythology, famously featured in Homer’s "The Odyssey".
        </p>
        <p>Avatar Wiki categorizes Polyphemus as a "gas giant," encircled by a lethal halo of charged particles. Its radiation belts are notably more energetic than those of Jupiter, with the innermost moonlets enduring radiation levels exceeding 4500 rem per day. This perilous environment is intensified by the planet's higher metallicity. Like Jupiter, Polyphemus primarily comprises "hydrogen and helium," However, while Jupiter is renowned for its striking white, red, and brown hues, highlighted by the iconic Great Red Spot, Polyphemus stands out with its captivating blue appearance.
        </p>
        <p>I need you to understand something crucial: the image you see above is from the movie Avatar, released in 2009. The vision and creativity that inspired this cinematic masterpiece have sparked a deep conversation about our own reality. Make no mistake—there is no way for any human being, whether an astronaut or a data analyst, to turn Jupiter blue. Only God holds that power. The release of Avatar in 2009 wasn't just a cinematic event; it was a prophetic moment that foreshadowed the transformation of our universe. This is a warning, a clarion call: Pandora's box has been opened. Beware!
        </p>
        <p>Now, let’s talk about the Great Blue Spot on Jupiter, first discovered in 2016 by NASA's Juno spacecraft. Yes, I said it, our Jupiter has turned BLUE! Unlike the well-known Great Red Spot, a massive storm raging in Jupiter's atmosphere, the Great Blue Spot is a profound magnetic anomaly situated near the planet's equator. The groundbreaking Juno mission allowed scientists to map Jupiter's magnetic field with unprecedented precision, unveiling this extraordinary feature. This is not just a scientific revelation; it's a cosmic reminder of the mysteries of creation and the power that transcends our understanding. We must heed these signs and awaken to the reality that our world is forever intertwined with the divine.
